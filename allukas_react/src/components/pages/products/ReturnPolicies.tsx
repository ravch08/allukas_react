        Returns will be accepted for up to 10 days of Customer’s receipt or

      <ul className="my-4 flex flex-col gap-2 pl-4">
        <li>– Received the wrong item.</li>
        <li>– Item arrived not as expected (ie. damaged packaging).</li>
        <li>– Item had defects.</li>
        <li>– Over delivery time.</li>
        <li>
          – The shipper does not allow the goods to be inspected before payment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The returned product(s) must be in the original packaging, safety
        wrapped, undamaged and unworn. This means that the item(s) must be
        safely packed in a carton box for protection during transport, possibly
        the same carton used to ship to you as a customer.
