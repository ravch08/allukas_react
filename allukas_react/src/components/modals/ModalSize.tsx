        <h3 className="mb-4">Jewelry Sizing Guide</h3>
        <p>
          This guide will help you find the perfect fit for your jewelry.
          Remember, sizing can vary between brands, so it's always a good idea
          to refer to the specific size chart provided by the seller if
          available.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-4 mt-8">Rings</h3>
        <p>
          Rings should fit comfortably on your finger without feeling too loose
          or constricting. To measure your finger size, you can:
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Use a ring sizer tool: These are available online or at most jewelry
          stores. Wrap the sizer tool around your finger until it fits snugly,
          then note the size indicated. Measure a ring that already fits you:
          Wrap a piece of paper or string around the base of your finger and
          mark the spot where it meets. Measure the distance between the marks
          in millimeters (mm) and use a ring size chart to find your
          corresponding size. **Ring Size Chart (Reference Only):**

        <p>
          Earrings come in a variety of styles and sizes, so it's important to
          consider your personal preferences and facial features when choosing a
          pair. Here are some tips for measuring your ears for earrings:
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Earlobe length: Measure from the bottom of your earlobe to the
          piercing hole.
          <br />
          Earlobe width: Measure the widest part of your earlobe.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remember, these are just general guidelines. The best way to find the
          perfect earrings for you is to try on different styles and sizes to
          see what looks and feels best.
